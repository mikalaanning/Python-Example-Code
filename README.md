# Python-Example-Code
Some of my Python projects throughout the years.

In the dataCollection.py my goal were to use an ZED 2 Camera to simply collect images later used for machine learning. 
The task were to collect images of three different buoys, yellow, red and green. And to save additionaly work, automaticly store them in each folder 
with a name corresponding to their color and an number.
This were done using the OpenCV libary. In the progress of achiving this functionality I created a couple of other python programs understanding the connection between the camera, OpenCV and Python.
